# impulse49-61-bitwig-controller
A Bitwig controller script for the Novation Impulse 49/61.

Bitwig's Impulse25 controller script is buggy and didn't work for my Impulse61. So I decided to make a controller script that will.

This controller script does everything that the Impulse25 script is supposed to do, plus a few extra, advanced, options.
The goal: replace the mouse and keyboard with Impluse where it makes sense (to me, at least).
